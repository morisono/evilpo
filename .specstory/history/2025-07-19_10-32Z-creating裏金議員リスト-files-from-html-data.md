# Creating裏金議員リスト files from HTML data (2025-07-19 10:32Z)

Create #file:裏金議員リスト.txt and #file:裏金議員リスト.yaml as same as #file:壺議員リスト.yaml etc.

Source: #file:index.html

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create the `裏金議員リスト.txt` and `裏金議員リスト.yaml` files by extracting the names from the HTML table in `index.html`. First, let me examine the existing files to understand the structure and then extract the data. Now let me check the current contents of the CSV file to see if it has the data: Now I have a good understanding of the structure. I can see that:
1. The `壺議員リスト.txt` contains formatted addresses for different politicians
2. The `裏金議員一覧.csv` contains the names and data for the 46 politicians involved in the slush fund scandal
3. The HTML file shows these 46 names in a table format

Let me extract the names from the HTML and create the corresponding files. First, let me create the `裏金議員リスト.txt` file with the names extracted from the HTML: 
```

```
Now let me create the YAML file. First, let me check how the CSV data is structured to create a proper YAML format: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully created both files:

1. **`裏金議員リスト.txt`** - Contains a simple list of the 46 politicians' names extracted from the HTML table, one name per line.

2. **`裏金議員リスト.yaml`** - Contains the complete structured data in YAML format with all the details from the CSV file, including:
   - Name (名前)
   - Electoral district (選挙区)
   - Area (エリア)
   - Amount of slush fund money (裏金金額)
   - Official/unofficial status (公認・非公認)
   - Party disciplinary action (党の処分)

Both files now contain the same information about the 46 politicians involved in the slush fund scandal (裏金議員), structured in the same way as the existing `壺議員リスト` files but with the data from the `index.html` source and the `裏金議員一覧.csv` file.
